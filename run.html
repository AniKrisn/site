    <h4>Run</h4>
    <pre>
run far and forget
there is no way or thing to know
go to the place that places go
without image, no idea set
run far now child, and soon forget

run toward all colours of steam
and sweat and ire and trickery
awash and stained with misery
and let it break each free, clean bone
run far now child, and let them know
that nothing really breaks or cries
but simple love that hurts awhile
from simple laughs, and simple smiles
and silent walks in single file

so now run child, and then forget
find where hallowed secrets kept
where images stay to hide and reek,
and every carcass soundly sleeps,
remembering that guilty hand
that took your fears and made them true
and from that bloomed a love anew
and from which came the mystery
which speaks in terms of destiny
and tells you all its dreary tales
until that very hallowed grave
which spurned and spun out secrets true
by turning mirrors unto you

so run now, child, run far and wide
run deftly 'til you hit a stride
and on the road like me you'll find
the calloused, stone-clear sound of mind,
free from name or hellish-bent
and hardship as its truest friend
