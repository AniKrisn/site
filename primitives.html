    <h4>1: Background</h4>
    <p>There are a couple ideas from computability theory I find endlessly fascinating.
        A vast class of complexity can arise from scaling a few
        <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_recursive_function" id="quote">primitive functions.</a></u>
        The scaling process, and in particular the primitives themselves, can be simple. If you have an array of numbers, you get
        huge results just with the successor function ("add 1 to this value"), zero function ("make this value 0"), some ability
        to move values around, and some way to check equivalence between them. With just those primitives, and scale, you get a
        good chunk of what one is able to express in mathematical language. In fact, it is difficult to find functions that you
        <i>can't</i> get from scaling those simple primitives (especially ones that are useful or interesting). Actually, that's what
        computability theory is about - figuring out what the limits are; what we <i>can't</i> get from scale. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It was that idea in particular: there's a lot of power and awe in scaling the right primitives.
    </p>
    <p>
        We see this elsewhere: every subfield of mathematics has vast complexity arising from various scaling rules
        (in this case, rules of logical inference) and a certain set of axioms. Change the axioms, and you get a different
        field of math. The choice of axioms is an interesting discussion, but rarely a part of education (maybe for good
        reason; better to just <i>get on with it</i>). In set theory, this discussion has been ongoing for a couple hundred years.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are, and have been for some time, similar observations in machine learning:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        The <u><a href="https://gwern.net/scaling-hypothesis#blessings-of-scale" id="quote">blessings of scale</a></u> is the
        observation that for deep learning, hard problems are easier to solve than easy problems—everything gets better as
        it gets larger (in contrast to the usual outcome in research, where small things are hard and large things
        impossible). The bigger the neural net/compute/data/problem, the faster it learns, the better it learns, the
        stabler it learns, and so on. A problem we can't solve at all at small <i>n</i> may suddenly become straightforward
        with millions or billions of <i>n</i>. “NNs are lazy”: they can do far more than we make them do when we push them beyond
        easy answers & cheap shortcuts. The <u><a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html" id="quote">bitter lesson</a></u>
        is the harder and bigger, the better.
        <p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -0.5vh;">(<u><a href="https://gwern.net/scaling-hypothesis" id="quote">The Scaling Hypothesis</a></u>)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Here there are some really interesting <u><a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/will-scaling-work" id="quote">questions posed</a></u> about the
        consequences and limits of scale.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are other examples in cellular automata theory (e.g. Game of Life, in which a handful of simple rules can
        give rise to life-like patterns), statistical mechanics (e.g <u><a href="https://eater.net/boids" id="quote">Boids algorithm</a></u>, a program
        that simulates the flocking behaviour of birds), graph theory (e.g the compounding effects of social networks as they
        scale), economics (e.g the compounding effects of simple supply/demand rules), and many more fields I'm not at all
        qualified to talk about. These aren't evolutionary processes, because there need not be variation or selection/survival
        pressures - rather, the selected variables <i>are</i> the simple primitives and scaling processes carried out over enough
        time/iterations for emergent complexity to arrive.
    </p>

    <p>
        There's something to say about abusing mathematical concepts by using them outside of their insulated home environment.
        Using concepts metaphorically. That's a balancing act I'm still figuring out. Regardless, I enjoy seeing the ways in which
        the patterns unfold in total abstraction and later trying to notice whether they unfold outside too: on the roadside, in
        bars and restaurants, in schools and hospitals, with real people and real struggles. This case has been interesting;
        watching the primitives scale the mundane. 
    </p>
    <h4>2: Problem</h4>
    <p>
        Times before were simpler. Culture was simpler: relationships, politics, morality. And then: work, bureaucracy, everything the average
        person has to do, just to get by. The daily life of the citizenry has been drenched in complexity, and some are drowning.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of <u><a href="https://x.com/visakanv/status/1588796630287147009?lang=en" id="quote">Visa's</a></u> talking points is that while "our ancestors got picked off
        by megafauna, our peers get picked off by psychofauna". Megafauna meaning "big scary tiger", and psychofauna meaning "infohazards"
        (i.e. harmful memes/ideologies). Both are exceedingly difficult to fend against when you do not have the right tools, and the tools in
        each case look very different. 
    </p>

    <p>
        For example: in the past it was necessary to be resourceful. There's a part from <i>Titan, The Life of John D. Rockefeller</i> that I like, where Rockefeller
        recalls a story about his mother from when he was young:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Mother had whooping cough and was staying in her room so that we should not catch it. When she heard thieves trying to get at the back of the house
        and remembered that there was no man to protect us, she softly opened the window and began to sing some old Negro melody, just as if the family were up
        and about. The robbers turned away from the house, crossed the road to the carriage house, stole a set of harness and went down the hill to their boat at
        the shore.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        When resources are scarce, survival requires getting more from less. Now resourcefulness is rewarded, but it's not as much a necessity -
        except when you're throwing yourself into relative scarcity, in
        <u><a href="https://paulgraham.com/relres.html" id="quote">startups</a></u>, <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWPi4zjltq4" id="quote">sport</a></u> or elsewhere. 
    </p>

    <p>
        By comparison, doing well now, I think, requires a certain kind of shrewdness combined with the ability to spot things.
        Taking in a lot of information and pruning it down to what really matters - the good, and the bad. In games like early-stage
        investing, doing well comes from spotting good things and being right. Since good spots are few in between, and those good
        spots make up for all the bad ones, investors are terribly afraid of missing good spots. In games like cybersecurity, doing
        well comes from spotting bad things and being right.
        <u><a href="https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/we-all-live-on-a-knifes-edge-and" id="quote">"We all live on a knife's edge, and it's fine".</a></u>
         Psychofauna is the human version of this. Being exposed to vast amounts of information will require individuals and groups to set
         up cognitive defences against informational pathogens; regulate their information diet and immune system. Experience helps with
         both, which is maybe in part why 'age of achievement, discovery, agency, and impact <u><a href="https://anilv.com/age" id="quote">is increasing </a></u>
         across industries and fields.' Complexity is a killer wave. 
    </p>

    <p>
        So, what to spot? How to look? Here's the idea: if that complexity comes from scale, I think we can get some decent
        idea by looking for the primitives. Dissolving complexity by figuring out where it came from. I wonder whether seeing
        scale, seeing opportunities, really amounts to seeing the primitives. Figuring out which primitives you're looking
        for takes work - and then hard work again in nurturing and scaling correctly. But can a project really take off with
        the wrong primitives? Can a system scale robustly without the right ones?
    </p>

    <p>
        Where some math goes forwards from primitives, computability goes backwards and tries to find the methods of
        computation that can create the same class of complexity (Church-Turing thesis) - and, of course, its limits.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maybe we can go backwards in the class of everyday problems too.
    </p>

    <h4>3: Solution</h4>
    <p>We know that foundations matter, and the importance of this idea makes it worth reiterating. But there's more: if
        thinking from first principles is a model for action, then this is a model for better planning and perception. It
        may help spot fledgling, tacit traits that have the potential to grow: both constructively, and destructively.
    </p>

    <p>
        The results of scale can be modified and erased, but the primitives are stable. Some primitives are created or
        actively chosen, like "values". Others are assigned, like <u><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1131592" id="quote">basic personality traits.</a></u>
        Searching for primitives may help with, for example, screening correctly and hiring overlooked and underappreciated
        <u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Identify-Energizers-Creatives-Winners/dp/1250275814/ref=sr_1_1?crid=P7Q5F02VZL2P&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.trWOQ3gaS70M_vSWq--dGCj69VgeNCmjtQwmz6ZrAl8WkJ9-Ky_j0mpqXw5WSXG7-HjXQaTqNgYQpLBIsDJmVDvvsBtEOi7lzTgcpwYKHd4.xPmZf3TfuXLAgL5NfgbfNj5LJDE1bnE3vbd-eDz4Iyo&dib_tag=se&keywords=talent+tyler+cowen&qid=1725441819&sprefix=talent+tyler+cowe%2Caps%2C309&sr=8-1" id="quote">talent.</a></u>
        It might help to be wary of structures in which one expects certain primitives that, upon closer inspection, are nowhere to be
        found. In those structures, if you listen carefully, you might hear <u><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/" id="quote">Moloch</a></u>
        laughing in the shadows. The primary objective of schools, for example, should be to instil and develop certain primitives:
        curiosity, playfulness, creativity. We easily spot these in young children. But how about when they grow up through these
        systems and graduate? Are those key traits still there in those that do well? How about those that don't? We can also spot
        primitives of great characters in stories who undergo transformations, and primitives of real characters who make change
        (apart from all the obvious ones, <i>Let My People Go Surfing</i> by Founder of Patagonia, Yvon Chouinard, comes to mind).
        There are glimpses of character like light seeping in through cracks, and we usually get several chances to notice.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can also get a sense for the primitives of different communities. I've forgotten who said it: on Instagram people
        try to be like brands, and on Twitter brands try to be like people. Parts of a social graph values IQ. Other parts value
        taste, and other parts charisma. Where there wasn't much of a choice before, individuals and groups are paralyzed for
        choice today. Choosing for good environments and <i>building</i> good environments requires perspicacity and spotting the right things. 
    </p>

    <p>
        We often fail while trying to address problems at a high level; while trying to cull the emergent consequences of scaling
        certain primitives we'd prefer not to have in the first place. But by doing so, we're cutting weeds rather than digging up
        the roots. We forget, for example, to ask this question for things that <u><a href="https://x.com/nickcammarata/status/1825569610822996365" id="quote">matter the most to us.</a></u>
    </p>

    <p>
        Here's a funny little story from writer Paul Coelho:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>There was once a businessman who was sitting by the beach in a small Brazilian village. As he sat, he saw a Brazilian fisherman rowing a small boat towards the shore having caught quite few big fish.</p>
    
        <p>The businessman was impressed and asked the fisherman, “How long does it take you to catch so many fish?” The fisherman replied, “Oh, just a short while.”</p>
        
        <p>“Then why don’t you stay longer at sea and catch even more?”</p>
        
        <p>“This is enough to feed my whole family,” the fisherman said.
        The businessman then asked, “So, what do you do for the rest of the day?”</p>
        
        <p>“Well, I usually wake up early in the morning, go out to sea and catch a few fish, then go back and play with my kids.
        In the afternoon, I take a nap with my wife, and evening comes, I join my buddies in the village for a drink — we play guitar,
        sing and dance throughout the night.”</p>
        
        <p>The businessman offered a suggestion. “I am a PhD in business management. I could help you to become a more successful person.
            From now on, you should spend more time at sea and try to catch as many fish as possible. When you have saved enough money, you
            could buy a bigger boat and catch even more fish. Soon you will be able to afford to buy more boats, set up your own company,
            your own production plant for canned food and distribution network. By then, you will have moved out of this village and to Sao
            Paulo, where you can set up HQ to manage your other branches.”</p>
        
        <p>The fisherman continues, “And after that?” The businessman laughs heartily, “After that, you can live like a king in your
            own house, and when the time is right, you can go public and float your shares in the Stock Exchange, and you will be rich.”
            The fisherman asks, “And after that?”</p>
        
        <p>The businessman says, “After that, you can finally retire, you can move to a house by the fishing village, wake up early
            in the morning, catch a few fish, then return home to play with kids, have a nice afternoon nap with your wife, and when
            evening comes, you can join your buddies for a drink, play the guitar, sing and dance throughout the night!”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        And here's another, not so funny story, on <u><a href="https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/p/the-decay-of-boeing" id="quote">The Decay of Boeing,</a></u>
        and a <u><a href="https://x.com/mmjukic/status/1825919774586552736" id="quote">related thread </a></u>on the tragedy of leadership with the wrong primitives.
    </p>

    <p>
        And more recently, in a <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc9jFbxrkMk" id="quote">talk</a></u> by Rory Sutherland:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Why does that question never get asked? Because it's an open-ended question. And business people, governments,
            politicians aren't looking to solve problems, they're looking to win arguments. And the way you win an argument
            is you pretend that what should be an open-ended question with many possible right answers (make it enjoyable, have
            free booze on the train, put Wi-Fi on the train, have a ball pit on the train for kids) - those are multiple and
            involve subjective decision-making and human judgement. You can't win an argument with those. So what you do is
            pretend this is a high-school maths problem with a single right answer, you solve for the right answer using
            high-school maths, and then nobody can argue with you because apparently you haven't made a decision, you've
            simply <i>'followed the data'.</i></p>
        <p>This is a massive problem in decision-making: we close down the solution space of any problem in order to arrive
            at a single right answer which is difficult to argue with. It's a huge creative opportunity cost."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Jensen Huang has made a <u><a href="https://youtu.be/8Pfa8kPjUio?si=6zAlyKgnFaxzwlFt" id="quote">similar point,</a></u>
        advocating for using "words" and arguments, instead of numbers (which are obviously valuable,
        but can also be chosen to suit any agenda, avoid real question-asking/problem-solving, and conjure up dangerous mirages).
    </p>

    <p>
        Part of the reason why 'following the data' is so convincing is that it's highly
        <u><a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/" id="quote">legible.</a></u> Other answers are not so legible
        or easy to explain and understand because the underlying problem space isn't either. There are decisions we make many
        times each day when sensemaking about our surroundings, and tools we use to reduce the complexity in that decision-making.
        But those tools often fail us because they are reductive.
    </p>

    <p>
        Measuring others based on status hides the fact, for example, that often status is a rapidly deprecating good, always in flux,
        and those currently with low or high status may be in a very different place in the future. Filtering others based on qualifications
        hides the fact, for example, that past success is a poor predictor for future success in dynamic work environments. Relying on these
        signals is <i>easy</i> - because it makes sensemaking easy - but there may be significant trade-offs in accuracy. On the other hand:
        uncovering primitives is legible, simple, relatively easy (where it's possible and meaningful to do so), and—maybe a better heuristic
        for approximating the journey of a complex system.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here's a trivial example to tie this altogether: several people I admire speak to the virtue of reading books. But "read books" never
        worked for me, and I doubt if it's really helped anyone. Over the last couple years I've maintained a reading habit - I now benefit
        from its fruits, and agree with those who made the suggestion. But "read books" did not give me the activation energy to start or the
        discipline to keep going. There were a bunch of false starts when I was reading <i>to read</i>. Instead, when I worked on cultivating
        curiosity, I slowly started reading more. And because I was more curious, I started listening to podcasts, asking better questions,
        reading papers, listening to interviews and lectures, etc. So cultivating the right primitive did a lot more for me than starting a
        reading habit. I think this holds for "learn to code", "meditate", "write more", etc. I hear these a lot. They're right, but unhelpful
        - because they affirm the consequent rather than explaining an effective method for producing it. Whereas, where effort is taken to
        cultivate the right primitives, the consequent behaviour
        <u><a href="https://www.livingneighborhoods.org/ht-0/whatisanunfolding.htm" id="quote">unfolds</a></u> naturally.
    </p>

    <p>
        The point is: I think we can trace complexity back to its roots more often, and get useful signals for perception, planning and
        decision-making in the process. As mentioned at the top, there are limits to this. But sometimes I feel the question begging to be
        asked. And oftentimes, it helps.
    </p>

        "What are the primitives here?"
